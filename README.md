# DPV Mitgliederverwaltung

The **Deutscher Parkour Verband (DPV) Membership Management API** is a backend service designed to manage users, parkour sports clubs, organizations, and their memberships within the German Parkour Association infrastructure.

## About

This API serves as the backbone for a comprehensive membership management platform that allows:

- **User Management**: Registration, authentication, and profile management for individuals
- **Club & Organization Management**: Creation and administration of parkour clubs and organizations  
- **Membership Processing**: Applications, approvals, and hierarchical membership structures
- **Verification Systems**: Email verification and password reset workflows
- **Graph-Based Relationships**: Support for complex organizational hierarchies (e.g., Landesverbände)

## Features

- ✅ **User Registration & Authentication**: Secure user accounts with strong password requirements
- ✅ **HTTP Basic Authentication**: Stateless authentication for API requests
- ✅ **Email Verification**: Secure email verification and change workflows
- ✅ **Password Reset**: Self-service password reset with secure token-based links
- 🚧 **Club Management**: Create and manage parkour clubs and organizations (in development)
- 🚧 **Membership Applications**: Apply for and process DPV memberships (planned)
- 🚧 **Graph Relationships**: Handle complex organizational hierarchies (planned)

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Go 1.25
- **Router**: [httprouter](https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter) - Fast HTTP routing
- **Database**: [ArangoDB](https://arangodb.com/) - Multi-model database (documents + graphs)
- **Authentication**: HTTP Basic Auth with bcrypt password hashing
- **Configuration**: YAML-based configuration management
- **Testing**: Go's built-in testing with test database support

```

## Prerequisites

- **Go**: Version 1.25 or higher
- **ArangoDB**: Version 3.x (local or remote instance)
- **Make**: For build automation

## Getting Started

### 1. Database Setup

Start ArangoDB locally using Docker:

```
docker run -d \
--name arangodb \
-p 8529:8529 \
-e ARANGO_ROOT_PASSWORD=change-me \
arangodb/arangodb:latest
```

### 2. Configuration

Copy the example configuration and customize it:

```
cp config.example.yml config.yml
```

Update `config.yml` with your ArangoDB credentials:

```
db:
  host: localhost
  port: 8529
  user: root
  pass: change-me
auth:
  dpv_secret_key: your-secret-key-here
```

### 3. Build and Run

Build the application:

```
make build
```

Run tests:

```
make test
```

Start the server:

```
make run
# Or with custom port:
PORT=3000 make run
# Or with Unix socket:
UNIX=/tmp/dpv.sock make run
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080` (or your specified port).

## API Endpoints

### Public Endpoints

- `GET /dpv/version` - Get API version
- `POST /dpv/users` - Register a new user

### Authenticated Endpoints (require HTTP Basic Auth)

- `GET /dpv/users/me` - Get current user profile

### Example Usage

**Register a new user:**
```
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/dpv/users \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
"email": "user@example.com",
"password": "SecurePass123!",
"name": "Doe",
"vorname": "John"
}'
```

**Get current user (with authentication):**
```
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/dpv/users/me \
-u "user@example.com:SecurePass123!"
```

## Password Requirements

Passwords must meet the following criteria:
- Minimum 10 characters
- At least 8 different character types
- Cannot be only digits, only upper case, only lower case, etc.
